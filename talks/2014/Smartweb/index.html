    <h2>CSS colours</h2>
    <p>The first versions of Mosaic and Netscape Navigator used the X11 colors as the basis for the Web colors list, as both were originally X applications. The W3C specifications SVG and CSS level 3 module Color eventually adopted the X11 list with some changes. It is a superset of the 16 “VGA colors” defined in HTML 3.2 and CSS level 1.</p>

    <h2>X-11 colours</h2>
    <p><mark>It is not known who originally compiled the list.</mark> The list does not show a continuity either in selected color values or in color names, and many color triplets have multiple names. Despite this, graphic designers and others got used to them, making it practically impossible to introduce a different list.</p>

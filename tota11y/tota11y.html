<h2>Version 1! ("Justifiably melancholic otter")</h2>
<p>Jackified the design (<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/HZ8mIxbyepOAMrXGpDG0Fg/Tota11y-tool?node-id=11%3A905">kind of</a>) so it doesn't look 100% like a slug vommed all over the browser. Huzzah!</p>
<h2>Version 0.7 ("Psychopathic Tapeworm")</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Contrast checker now ignores transparent (therefore, invisible) text, eg on Amazon, Guardian</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.6 ("Concupiscent Cormorant")</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Empty elements plugin: downgrade empty <code>p</code> and multiple <code>br</code> elements to warning (was
		error), as
		they may indicate shonky CSS but aren't a disaster for a11y</li>
	<li>Add tests for empty nav, header, main, aside, footer, figcaption. These will be announced to screen reader users
		(but will be empty)
		and justifiably make people furiously grumpy.</li>
	<li>When hovering over a tota11y label, max its z-index in case it is obscured by a nearby label in busy pages.
	</li>
	<li>Make the menu responsive when screen is zoomed to 200%</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.5 ("Insouciant hedgehog")</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A criminally ugly test to suppress reporting contrast violations if text is visually hidden using the common <a
			href="https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/2013-01-11-how-to-hide-content/">clip pattern</a> which we use
		on Babylon. This is to reduce false positives which erode trust in the test.</li>
	<li>Feelthy hack to fix clean-up bug in new Titles module</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.4 ("Sultry panda")</h2>
<ul>
	<li>New Titles module to show missing titles on iframes (error), and warnings for superfluous titles on other things
		erroneously put
		there to placate the false
		idols of Search Engine Optimists (see <a
			href="https://www.24a11y.com/2017/the-trials-and-tribulations-of-the-title-attribute/">The Trials and
			Tribulations of the Title Attribute</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.3 ("Mellifluous ostrich")</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Correct calculation of contrast ratio in the contrast module to take account of boldness of text and not just
		rely on font-size. (Thanks <a
			href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/devtools/shared/accessibility.js#23">Mozilla dev
			tools</a>!)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.2 ("Uninhibited gibbon")</h2>
<ul>
	<li>New module to highlight empty elements, eg heading and paragraphs, which was a constant bugbear on US marketing
		site</li>
	<li>Tweaked img/alt module to ask users to check accuracy of alt text (rather than perhaps falsely-reassure that
		presence of alt text is actually useful)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.176303987 ("Obstreperous rhinoceros")</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Add links to Babylon DNA guidance where applicable</li>
	<li>Split out modules into 'designers'/ content editors and Developers (was 'Experimental')</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.1 ("Lachrymose Lemur")</h2>
<ul>
	<li>New module to expose HTML5 landmarks (footer, header etc) and explicitly set ARIA roles (but not those that are
		implicit, because that's not as useful for diagnosing coder errors)</li>
	<li>Tweaked name and description module to stop referring to 'screen readers'; added exposure of value attribute on
		<code>input type=submit</code> fields (as that is what gets exposed and wasn't being reported). Add value of
		<code>aria-describedby</code> attributes as that is also passed to AT, especially as <a
			href="https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2014/12/using-aria-describedby-to-provide-helpful-form-hints/">hints/
			instructions on form fields</a>
	</li>
</ul>

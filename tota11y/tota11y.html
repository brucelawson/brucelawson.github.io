<h1>Version 2.4 "Insouciant hedgehog"</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Make it responsive when screen is zoomed, as discovered by Taylar.</li>
	<li>A criminally ugly hack to suppress reporting contrast violations if text is visually hidden using the common <a
		href="https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/2013-01-11-how-to-hide-content/">clip pattern</a> which we use
	on Babylon. This is to reduce false positives which erode trust in the test.</li>
	<li>Fixed clean-up bug in new Titles module</li>
	<li>New Titles module to show missing titles on iframes, and superfluous titles on other things erroneously put
		there to placate the false
		god of Search Engine Optimists</li>
	<li>Correct calculation of contrast ratio in the contrast module to take account of boldness of text and not just
		rely on font-size. (Thanks <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/devtools/shared/accessibility.js#23">Mozilla dev tools</a>!)</li>
	<li>New module to highlight empty elements, eg heading and paragraphs, which was a constant bugbear on US marketing
		site</li>
	<li>Tweaked img/alt module to ask users to check accuracy of alt text (rather than perhaps falsely-reassure that
		presence of alt text is actually useful)</li>
	<li>Add links to Babylon DNA guidance where applicable</li>
	<li>Split out modules into 'designers'/ content editors and Developers (was 'Experimental')</li>
	<li>New module to expose HTML5 landmarks (footer, header etc) and explicitly set ARIA roles (but not those that are
		implicit, because that's not as useful for diagnosing coder errors)</li>
	<li>Tweaked name and description module to stop referring to 'screen readers'; added exposure of value attribute on
		<code>input type=submit</code> fields (as that is what gets exposed and wasn't being reported). Add value of
		<code>aria-describedby</code> attributes as that is also passed to AT, especially as <a
			href="https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2014/12/using-aria-describedby-to-provide-helpful-form-hints/">hints/
			instructions on form fields</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>To Do:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>When hovering over a tota11y label, bump its z-index in case it is obscured by a nearby label in busy pages.</li>
	<li>Get it designed and content reviewed</li>
</ol>

<p>Forked from <a href="https://github.com/Khan/tota11y">Khan Academy</a> (who seem to have abandoned it) by Brucie for Babz.</p>
